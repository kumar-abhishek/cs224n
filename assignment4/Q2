Q2. Analyzing NMT Systems (30 points)
1. Identify the error in the NMT translation.
2. Provide possible reason(s) why the model may have made the error (either due to a specific
linguistic construct or a specific model limitation).
3. Describe one possible way we might alter the NMT system to fix the observed error. There
are more than one possible fixes for an error. For example, it could be tweaking the size of the hidden layers or changing the attention mechanism.


i. (2 points) Source Sentence: Aqu ́ı otro de mis favoritos, “La noche estrellada”. 
Reference Translation: So another one of my favorites, “The Starry Night”. 
NMT Translation: Here’s another favorite of my favorites, “The Starry Night”.

Ans:
1. "So another" -> "Here's another"
2. ? 
3. ?

ii. (2 points) Source Sentence: Ustedes saben que lo que yo hago es escribir para los nin ̃os, y, de hecho, probablemente soy el autor para nin ̃os, ms ledo en los EEUU.
Reference Translation: You know, what I do is write for children, and I’m probably America’s most widely read children’s author, in fact.
NMT Translation: You know what I do is write for children, and in fact, I’m probably the author for children, more reading in the U.S.

Ans:
1. Error: "America’s most widely read children’s author" -> "the author for children, more reading in the U.S." 
2. Reason for error: 
  - " probablemente soy el autor para nin ̃os" means "I'm probably the author for kids"
  - "ms ledo en los EEUU." means "most read in the US"
  The NMT translated word by word without rearranging the words. 
3. Fix: Having a Bi-LSTM layer and/or more LSTM/RNN layers would probably help


iii. (2 points) Source Sentence: Un amigo me hizo eso – Richard Bolingbroke.
Reference Translation: A friend of mine did that – Richard Bolingbroke.
NMT Translation: A friend of mine did that – Richard <unk>

Ans:
1. Error: Bolingbroke -> <unk>
2. Reason: UNKs are not being replaced with original source language words which the model doesn't understand.
3. Fix: have a mapping maybe in the beginning to store the names before starting translation. Another one could be to add that name to the vocabulary. 
Lots of Answers in Lecture 9(60 min mark) for Winter 2019 lectures CS224N, strategies to deal with UNKs :
a. Train on a subset of vocabulary at a time.
b. Use attention to work out what you are translating: you can do something simple like dictionary lookup
c. Character models
